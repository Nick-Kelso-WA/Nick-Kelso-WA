- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nick-Kelso-WA
- 👀 I’m currently on GitHub for Flipper Zero Stuff.
- 🌱 I’m not a hacker, not trying to do anything sketchy, just using Flipper for fun.  Currently trying to create a remote for my car head unit.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning the Flipper. I am really new!  Just started.
- 📫 How to reach me ... nickreynolds.estacada.or@gmail.com  or look at my YouTube channel on Exercise and Travel, the Odd Man Out:  https://www.youtube.com/@oddman-out
- 😄 Pronouns: ...don't worry about it! I answer to anything!
